    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the player behavior using a dataset collected by a UBC Computer Science research group that ran a Minecraft server. As players joined and interacted with the world, the server recorded their individual information. This includes their age, name, gender, how many hours they played in total, their experience level, and whether they were subscribed to a game-related newsletter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses two datasets, `players.csv` and `sessions.csv`, collected from a Minecraft research server operated by UBC’s Computer Science department. The data record player demographics and in-game activity. My analysis will primarily use `players.csv`, as it includes both predictors and the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Dataset | Rows | Columns | Description |\n",
    "|----------|------|----------|--------------|\n",
    "| `players.csv` | 196 | 7 | Contains hashed emails (acts as player IDs) and variables such as age, gender, total playtime (hours), and newsletter subscription status |\n",
    "| `sessions.csv` | 1535 | 5 | Contains session-level data, including hashed emails, start and end times, and timestamp equivalents |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Issues**\n",
    "- Missing age for two players reduces usable data\n",
    "- Extreme playtime values (e.g., idle sessions) may report inaccurate playtimes\n",
    "- Subscription classes are imbalanced (many more “Yes” than “No”)\n",
    "- Predictors use different scales and must be standardized"

    "## Methods and Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use a K-NN classification model to predict subscription status using age and playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this method appropriate?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question is a binary classification problem (predicting subscription status [TRUE/FALSE]). The model predicts the outcome for a new player by finding the \"k\" closest players in the training data and using a majority vote on their subscription status. Unlike other methods, k-NN make sno assumptions about the underlying distribution of data, which is better when relationships might be complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What assumptions are required?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some variables with larger ranges like played hours could dominate the distance calculation during k-NN classification, therefore requiring data normalization. The performance of k-NN decreases as the number of variables increase, however since we only have a few variables it would be managable, however if we decide to add more from the sessions.csv dataset the method may weaken. k-NN Classification also assumes that the distance represents the similarity between players (selected variables) are relevant to subscription status. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the potential weaknesses or limitations of this model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If more data is gathered, k-NN could be computationally expensive and slow as it must calculate the distance for every data point for a new prediction. If irrelevant variables are included, it could introduce unwanted noise to the method, reducing accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to compare and select the model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare and select the model based on tuning for the best value of \"k\", implementing hyperparameter tuning, where 5-fold cross-validation will be used on the training dataset to maximize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are you going to process the data to apply this model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be first processed by splitting the players.csv dataset into a training set (75%) and a testing set (25%). Highly skewed data in played_hours and other variables will be standardized, while the missing values in the dataset (from the Age variable) could either be imputed using the median age (calculated by the training set) or by dropping the observations. Finally, the k-NN model will be trainied and the optimal \"k\" will be selected using k-fold cross-validation on the training set. The final model using the optimal \"k\" will be run on the testing set to report its final performance metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this model?**\n",
    "- It is suitable for categorical prediction using numerical predictors\n",
    "- It does not require any particular relationship between the predictors and the outcome variables, but only uses nearby datapoints\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions & Preparation**\n",
    "- Predictors will be standardized in a recipe using scaling and centering\n",
    "- Missing ages will be filled using the mean age\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "- Class imbalance (more subscribers) can bias results  \n",
    "- Extreme points could overly influence distance-based calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selection & Evaluation**\n",
    "- I will tune K (1–10) via 5-fold cross-validation using accuracy as the main metric\n",
    "- Data is split into 70% training, 30% testing \n",
    "- The K with highest validation accuracy will be used to fit the final model and the accuracy on the test data will be used to answer the question"
